A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet
at least once. For example, the sentence
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram
because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram.
Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
